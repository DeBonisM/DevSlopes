            And that's when it came to me! This is crouching position is pretty
            much a sit up. If I just get in and out of bed 100 times a day, it
            must work something out! Right! I trained <b>harder </b> than I have ever
            trained in my life. And now I feel better than I did as a hotdog
            mascot in the mall! With these simple tips and tricks I want to help
            you get winter ready!

            So, I started my own Cross-Fit company "Get Out of Bed". It's
            simple, it incorporates getting in and out of bed, getting off the
            couch and sitting on the couch. These are the daily motions that we
            make that I knew had to be capitalized on. So do just sit there and
            be a bum, sit there and feel the burn! <i> Contact me at </i> <div class="link">
