he provided mockup
Use any image editing software on your computer to: (advised but optional)
Draw "grids/flexbox" layouts (boxes) on the mockup where they might me used.
Draw "containers" (boxes) where content might be grouped.
Most computers have basic software to do this. Apple: Preview / Windows: Paint . You're also welcome to use any Adobe apps or Sketch - whatever gets the job done =)
Use your choice of CSS Grid and/or Flexbox for layout.
Now that you have visually "mocked up" the mockup with grid and flex layouts - build it üòÅ
At this point you have learned everything you need to replicate this website using HTML and CSS.

üõ† Requirements:
The website MUST resemble the mockup as closely as possible (element spacing/layout, font colors, size, etc).
Must include the mobile meta tag in the HTML <head> to enable mobile responsiveness for the website.
The website MUST be mobile responsive and respond appropriately on desktop, iPad/tablet, and mobile phone screen sizes. This means the elements should be appropriately spaced and adjust dynamically to fit nicely into the given space of the viewport - everything from the navbar to footer. The website should fit nicely on viewport sizes: 1200px, 768px, 375px.
When the viewport reaches 768px, the navigation links are replaced with menu (trigram) icon.
You can eyeball the font-sizes and image sizes
Add images of your own to replace those in the mockup
You can use lorem ipsum as placeholder text throughout the website.
HTML must follow a consistent indentation pattern. (HTML style guide)
CSS must follow a consistent indentation pattern.
No large gaps/empty space between elements.
No large gaps/empty space between css style rules.

üí° Tips:
Use flexbox or grid to handle the layout (flex-wrap or grid column auto-fit). If leveraged correctly, you won't need to adjust any layout changes in your media queries.
Avoid duplicate styles (two different classes should not share the same exact style rules. A single class should be used and shared amongst the respective elements).
Theme:

Change the font-family to something of your liking. It can be a google font or a system font (i.e. Times New Roman)
headers / subtitles color: #6b6b6b
paragraph color: #999
Use fontawesome for free social media icons or dec/hex unicodes
footer color: #777 / white
footer background-color: #282828
Common breakpoints for device widths:

<= 599px: Mobile device
<=‚Ää768px: iPads, Tablets

1025px‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää1200px: Desktops, large screens
